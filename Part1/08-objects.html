      /*the lesson:
      1. objects = group related values together
      2. added a score to Rock Paper Scissors from this lesson.
      3. Built-in-objects (JSON, localStorage)
      4. More detail (null, auto-boxing, references)
      5. Shortcuts (destructuring, shorthand property, shorthand method)
      exercises: 5hr 25.
